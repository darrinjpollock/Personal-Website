<h1>The Summer Foodie Challenge</h1> 

<p>Because I have been tremendously busy this past year with teaching and taking graduate school courses, I have nearly abandoned cooking and baking for enjoyment. My challenge this summer is to try to make at least one dish or dessert each week. This weblog will capture my summer foodie journey of attempting a few recipes and providing commentary about the journey.</p>

		<td>The Kentucky Hot Brown is a traditional open-faced sandwich. It has a base of bread topped and sliced turkey breast drowned in a Pecorino Romano mornay sauce and topped with tomato slices and bacon. What's not to like? This is my attempt at taking a classic recipe up a notch.</td>
		<td>There are so many brownie recipes available. And why would you want to make brownies from scratch when boxed brownies are readily available and more convenient? If you are a brownie connoisseur, follow me on this journey to test Claire Saffitz's Malted "Forever" Brownies. Can they beat a box brownie?</td>
		<td>I have tried a few copycat recipes of Levain Bakery's famous Chocolate Chip Walnut Cookie with mixed results. Some were too complicated when it came to getting the bake just right. Will this recipe deliver a quality recipe that isn't too complicated when all I want is a good cookie?</td>
