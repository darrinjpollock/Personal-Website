<h1>About Me</h1> 

<p><img src="Headshot2.jpg" atl="Darrin J. Pollock"
	style="float:right;width:275px;height:300px;padding-left: 30px">
<p>My name is Darrin Pollock. By trade, I am an English teacher (and now the librarian of Walton-Verona Middle and High Schools). Yes, I enjoy developing and implementing lessons for students and helping them tackle the big ideas that a text presents. All of these are aspects of my trade. Yet my school professional identity is not the entirety of who I am.</p>

<p>Beyond my day job, I am an amateur cook and baker. This <strong>passion</strong> began when I was young, and I enjoyed eating everything that my grandmother made. She was known in the Raymond community (my hometown) as one of the best cooks. In fact, she was known for her drop biscuits, divinity candy, chicken and dumplings, and countless other confections. Her skills were honed after numerous years of cooking for her <i><b>six</b></i> sons, who had insatiable appetites as they worked and played on the farm.</p> 

<p>My grandmother’s cooking and baking skills were passed on to her daughter-in-law, my mother, who also passed on these skills to all four of her children. My siblings and I are proficient cooks/bakers, and each of us makes our own food specialty when the family comes together. I am known for my bakes or cooking that requires particular techniques or, as my mother says, <em>“has a lot of steps and makes a lot of dishes.”</em> I have honed my baking skills over the years through experience (read: trial and error) and simply challenging myself to make a variety of dishes and desserts. </p>
