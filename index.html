Welcome to my personal website. While some may know me as an English teacher at Walton-Verona High School (and now the Walton-Verona Middle and High School librarian), what others may not know about me is that I am also a foodie. I'm not talking about the stereotypical foodie who watches shows like <i>Chopped</i> on the <i>Food Network</i> and imagines in their own fairytale reality that they, too, have the expertise of the judges or the skill of the chefs. I'm also not talking about the foodie who always photographs their meals and posts them on Instagram for those addictive and sometimes elusive likes.
</p>

<p>I am simply a person who genuinely likes to cook and eat good food.</p>

<p>Join me on my Summer Foodie Challenge as I reclaim my foodie nature and try new recipes.</p>
