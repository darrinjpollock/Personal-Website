<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Nothing beats the smell of fresh-baked cookies wafting through the air. It always brings a smile to my face and a signal to my brain that no matter what is on the dinner menu, I <i>will</i> leave room for dessert. When it comes to cookies, I am a snob. If they aren't homemade, I will pass. Chips Ahoy cookies? Don't make me laugh. The rolls of cookie dough at the grocery store that you bake yourself? Greasy and artificial flavor-tasting. The "fresh-baked" cookies found in the baking section of the grocery store? Sad, dry husks of what could have been. The <i>only</i> quality cookie is homemade--full stop.</p>

<p>In the past decade or so, <a href="https://levainbakery.com/">Levain Bakery</a>, a New York City-based bakery, has built a solid reputation based on their cookies. As a side note, although Levain Bakery has expanded throughout New York City as well as other cities in the Northeast, you can find the original store here:

<p>Levain Bakery's cookies have gained notoriety, not only for their cookies' rather large size but also their soft, just-underdone interior. In foodie circles, this style of large, extra-soft interior cookie is sometimes dubbed a "New York-style" cookie. Levain Bakery paved the way for this style, and now, many bakeries throughout the U.S. are taking note and mimicking this wildly succesful product that has but Levain on the map. To see an older video of the Levain Bakery founders making their cookies, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61Zba8jh5Wg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, I have never eaten a Levain cookie. Through the bakery's website, you can order cookies to be sent to your home; however, everyone knows that the cookies simply will not be the same. The peak time to eat a cookie is just minutes after it has been baked. Thus, about a year ago, I began a quest to find a copycat recipe that would offer the best dupe of this renowned cookie.</p>

<p>I had tried two other recipes before with relative success. One recipe required me to add cornstarch to the dough and use cake flour in addition to all-purpose flour. Another recipe required a freezing period for the dough before baking the dough on <i>two</i> baking sheets in an oven at 400 degrees. The results were decent, but I knew there had to be a better recipe out there that offered an even better tasting cookie with less hassle. Eventually, I found it. </p>

<p>Stella Parks's recipe for <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/super-thick-chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe">Levain Bakery-Style Super-Thick Chocolate Chip Cookies</a> was a top-rated copycat Levain recipe, and I had to try it. Looking at the recipe ingredients, everything seemed rather standard. With my ingredients in hand, I began making the cookies.</p><br>

<h3>Making the Recipe</h3>

<p>First, I began with the ingredients needed for the creaming stage. Typically, I cream only the butter and sugars together, but I followed the recipe as it was written, which included adding a few ingredients most cookie recipes would have instructed to add separately to the dry ingredients. Also, the inclusion of nutmeg in the recipe seemed unusual. I went ahead and followed the recipe; however, I will have to note that if you use nutmeg, it is always better to grate whole nutmeg yourself rather than to use the ground nutmeg found in the spice aisle. The flavor of freshly ground whole nutmeg is infinitely better.</p>

<p>After creaming the butter with the sugars and other ingredients, you will get a result similar to the image below.</p>

<p>Next, the eggs were added one at a time.</p>

<p>The remaining dry ingredients were combined.</p>

<p>The dry ingredients were added to the egg and creamed mixture.</p>

<p>The chocolate chips and walnuts were combined . . .</p>

</div>

<p>And added to the dough.</p>

<p>Then, the dough was weighed and portioned . . .</p>

</div>

<p>And placed on a parchment-lined baking sheet. At this point, I added flaky salt to the tops of the dough. (I highly recommend this step.)</p>

<p>The cookies were baked for 20 minutes . . .</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Was this recipe a good copycat for the Levain cookie? Without having eaten a Levain cookie, I cannot offer a definitive answer. However, I can say that this recipe delivered one of the best-tasting cookies I have ever had. Also, the gradation of textures of the baked cookies were something to behold; the outside was crispy, while the interior was soft and the core exhibited a just-underdone quality. This recipe produces cookies that are absolutely irresistible.</p> 

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Here are a few notes to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The addition of nutmeg is a welcome "secret ingredient" in this recipe. Some individuals simply despise the flavor of nutmeg; however, I don't think they will even realize it is in this recipe. The spice blends so well with all of the other flavors that it becomes the <i>je ne sais quoi</i> ingredient that offers another flavor profile.</li>

<li>The recipe mixing steps should be followed as they are written. The method of combining ingredients works well for this recipe and produces cookies with excellent textures.</li>

<li>My only deviation from the recipe was chilling the dough. I did not chill the dough because I wanted cookies and was unwilling to wait for the dough to chill. Yes, chilled dough can encourage even better flavor. But be aware that if you can't wait to eat a cookie, chilling is not absolutely essential.</li>

<li>The recipe says to bake for 22 minutes. My cookies were ready after 20 minutes, perhaps because the dough was not chilled. I recommend that you begin watching the cookies at around 18 minutes to find that sweet spot of golden-brown exterior and soft interior.</li>
