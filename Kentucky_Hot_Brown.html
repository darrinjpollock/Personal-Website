<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
<p>Derby Day, the first Saturday in May, is a perfect opportunity to celebrate Kentucky culture. Interestingly, in Northern Kentucky, many individuals do not celebrate or even know about some aspects of Kentucky culture that I assumed was common knowledge. For example, some of my friends (born and rasied Kentuckians, mind you) did not know what a mint julep was, nor were they familiar with Kentucky Derby pie when I brought some to a Derby party. In fact, some offered heretical commentary: "It's kind of like the pecan pie filling." Upon hearing this, the Kentuckian aspect of my character was offended. Excuse me, but no, Kentucky Derby pie is <b><i>nothing</i></b> like pecan pie. I assured myself that they would better understand when it was time for dessert, and they could see for themselves the chocolate, walnuts, and buttery filling sitting atop a perfect sliver of pastry. But when I served the Kentucky Hot Brown, my friends were bewildered.</p>
<p>"What is this? It's not brown. Why is it called a Hot Brown?" they asked.</p>
<p>After a brief explanation, my friends began eating the dish and raved about the combination of flavors. I had used the original recipe from the Brown Hotel in Louisville, and the recipe did not disappoint. After the meal, I kept thinking about the recipe. That is when I decided that while the original recipe is excellent, perhaps, I could improve upon it. Thus began my journey with the Hot Brown.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Hot Brown was first created at the Brown Hotel in Louisville, and its history and the original recipe can be found <a href="https://www.brownhotel.com/dining/hot-brown">here</a>. Here is some information on its location if you are ever in the Louisville, KY area: </p>

<p>My goal in revisiting and updating this recipe was to offer some improvements.</p>
<p>Here are the issues I wanted to improve with my follow-up recipe:</p>

<div id="problems">
<ol>
	<li>The bread is plain white bread.</li>
	<li>The Mornay sauce is too thick.</li>
	<li>The Mornay sauce is not distributed throughout the dish.</li>
	<li>The bacon and tomatoes are not evenly distibuted.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>There is a time and place for plain white bread. Peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches? Yes. But for this revamped version of the Kentucky Hot Brown, I decided that a sourdough bread could add a depth of flavor. (I'm thinking of fondue).</p>
<p>The solution to the sauce being rather thick was first to substitute half-and-half for the milk and cream mixture. The original recipe calls for equal portions of milk and cream, and I was surprised that no one had thought to update the recipe to substitute half-and-half for the milk and cream since half-and-half is composed of half cream and half whole milk. Next, I reduced the flour, the thickening agent, by half. This created a creamier Mornay sauce that would be able to soak into the sandwich's components, like the toast, rather than simply sit on top of them and congeal.</p>
<p>The original recipe has the Mornay sauce distributed only on top. I determined that this updated version of the Kentucky Hot Brown needed sauce inside the sandwich, too. Therefore, I put the sauce on the toast so that the bread could soak up the cheesy Mornay sauce.</p>
<p>Finally, I determined the updated recipe needed more bacon. In fact, instead of simply laying down two slices of bacon on top of the dish as a finishing component, why not cut up the bacon and sprinkle it not only on top but also on top of the toast, along with more tomatoes? This way the tomato and bacon are always included in the perfect bite.</p>

<h4>Recipe</h4>
<div id="recipe">
<pre>
	3 T butter
	4 T all purpose flour
	2 cups half-and-half
	3/4 cup Pecorino Romano cheese, plus 1 T for garnish
	pinch of ground nutmeg
	salt (approx. 1/2 - 1 tsp) and pepper to taste
	14 oz. sliced roasted turkey breast
	4 slices of sourdough bread, toasted and crusts removed
	6 slices of bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces, fried, and divided into 4 portions
	2 medium-sized tomatoes, cut into 1/8 inch slices
	2 T of Parmesan cheese
	paprika
	chives
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Making the Recipe</h3>
<ol>
<li>In a two‑quart saucepan, melt the butter and slowly whisk in flour until combined and forms a roux. Continue to cook the roux for two minutes over medium‑low heat, stirring frequently.</li>
<li>Whisk the half-and-half into the roux, and cook over medium heat until the milk mixture begins to thicken and simmer, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the sauce from the heat, and slowly whisk in the Pecorino Romano cheese until the Mornay sauce is smooth. Add nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.</li><br>

</div><br>

<li>For each Hot Brown, place a slice of toast with both of its ends cut off (about 1/2 inch of both sides) in an oven safe dish. Then cut the other slide of bread in half. Place each half on either side of the other slice of toast to make an extended slice of toast.</li><br>

</div><br>
<li>Cover each Hot Brown toast in Mornay sauce (just enough to cover the toast), then tomato slices, and finally 1/4 of the bacon.</li>
<li>Add the turkey slices to each Hot Brown.</li>
<li>For each Hot Brown, cover the turkey with tomato slices, and then Mornay sauce. Top each Hot Brown with enough Mornay sauce to completely cover it. Sprinkle with additional Pecorino Romano and Parmesan cheese.</li>
<li>Place the entire dish under a broiler until the cheese begins to brown and bubble. Remove from the broiler.</li>
<li>Place the remaining bacon, divided equally, on the Hot Browns. Sprinkle the Hot Browns with paprika and chives. Serve immediately.</li>
